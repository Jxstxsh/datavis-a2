Principle of a scatterplot matrix:
- Combines more than 2 attributes
- Makes it possible to compare objects

How many scatterplots for n attributes?
- (n^2)-2
- But only ((n^2)-2)/2 unique scatterplots

Advantages and disadvantages:
- Advantages:
    - Ability to compare objects across several attributes
    - Visualize relationships 
- Disadvantages:
    - Increased cognitive load
    - Every object appears mutliple times
    - Not much space for labels
    - Scalability issues
